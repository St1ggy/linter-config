# Package and Exports Rules

- Keep `exports` explicit for root and every subpath.
- For each export, provide `import` and `types` entries.
- Keep `types` pointing to real declaration files.
- Use `sideEffects: false` unless a file intentionally has side effects.

## Dependency Policy

- Keep runtime deps only for code imported by exported configs.
- Put consumer-executed tools in peer dependencies (`eslint`, `prettier`, `stylelint`).
- Mark framework peers optional when presets are framework-specific.
- Remove stale packages when no config imports them.
