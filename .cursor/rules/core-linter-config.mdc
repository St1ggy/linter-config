# Core Linter Config Standards

- Keep package output ESM-first and deterministic.
- Prefer small, composable config modules over one large config file.
- Treat each exported config as a public API; avoid breaking behavior silently.
- Avoid side effects in config modules (no IO except explicit safe fallbacks).
- Keep examples and docs aligned with real exports.

## Required Quality Checks

- Run `npm run lint` after every config change.
- Keep files with LF ending newline and no trailing spaces.
- If dependency surface changes, update lockfile in the same change.
