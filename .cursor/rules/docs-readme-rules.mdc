# Documentation Rules

- Document all supported imports and prefer subpath import examples.
- Show tree-shaking-friendly usage first.
- Keep install steps short and tool-focused.
- Keep framework coverage explicit (React, Next.js, Svelte, and others if added).

## Change Communication

- If exports or peers change, update README in the same change.
- If defaults become stricter, include a short migration note.
- Keep examples copy-paste ready and consistent with actual exported paths.
