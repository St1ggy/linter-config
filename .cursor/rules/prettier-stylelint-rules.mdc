# Prettier and Stylelint Rules

- Keep Prettier config declarative and plugin list minimal.
- Keep Stylelint extends/plugins limited to what is used by exported presets.
- Do not keep deprecated or unused stylelint packages in dependencies.
- Use one canonical SCSS preset export and keep its rule intent documented.

## Compatibility

- Preserve compatibility with current major versions of Prettier and Stylelint.
- Put tool runtime requirements into peer dependencies when consumers execute the tool.
- If rule sets become strict, include migration notes in README.
